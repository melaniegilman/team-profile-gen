## Description

This application uses NODE.js to ask a user for input regarding team members, and generate the information onto a browser page by writing an HTML file.  When the user runs node index in the terminal, the user will be prompted for information regarding the team manager.  After entering this information, the user will be asked if they would like to enter information for an intern or engineer.  After the respective prompts, the user is given the option to add another team member (Y/N).  If the user selects Y, they are once again given the option of an intern or engineer, and given the respective prompts.  If the user selects N, the program is finished. Either way, the information that the user gave is written to an HTML file that is ready to view in a polished UI by clicking "view in default browser".  When viewing the team portfolio, the user may click on an email address and be taken to their default email program to compose an email to the corresponding address.  If the user should click on the GitHub, they will be taken to the team member's GitHub profile.
